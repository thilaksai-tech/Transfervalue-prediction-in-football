**Transfer value prediction in football**


This project focuses on predicting football player transfer values. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze various attributes of players and estimate their market values based on historical transfer data.

Steps Taken:

**1. Data Collection:**

Scraped player attributes and performance statistics from FIFA databases or APIs.
Gathered data such as player age, position, skill ratings, and historical transfer values.

**2. Data Preprocessing:**

Removed irrelevant attributes and handled missing data.
Ensured consistency in data types and formats across different datasets.

**3. Feature Engineering:**

Identified key attributes likely to influence player transfer values (e.g., age, position, performance metrics).
Engineered new features to enhance predictive power (e.g., player potential, international caps).

**4. Model Selection and Training:**

Selected appropriate regression models for predicting transfer values (e.g., linear regression, random forest regression).
Trained models on historical data, using techniques such as cross-validation to optimize performance.

**5. Model Evaluation:**

Evaluated models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Ensured models generalize well to new data and are robust against overfitting.

**6. Deployment and Usage:**

Provided instructions on how to use the trained model for making predictions.
Included sample code or scripts demonstrating prediction capabilities.

**7. Future Improvements:**

Discuss potential improvements such as incorporating additional data sources (e.g., player market sentiment, team performance).
Mention ongoing maintenance plans and community contributions.
